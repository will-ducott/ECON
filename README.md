# ECON
Useful functions pertaining to the different branches of economics.

##Installation
Currently not available to install, but will be created for R

##Roadmap
- Planning on the launch of a base list of functions for micro and macro economics by Dec. 2020
- Will continue with other more specific branches of economics after that
- Once basic functions are created for each branch, will delve into more complex and applicable functions for real world usage

##Contributions
If you would like to make contributions, just reach out. The more help the better, especially since my expertise starts to dwindle on more advanced coding and concepts

##License
[MIT]

##Note
This project is in very early stages, and will likely take some time to reach a practical level of usability
